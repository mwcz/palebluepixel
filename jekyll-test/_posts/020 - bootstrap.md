Surprise.

I've converted the site layout to
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap "Twitter Bootstrap").

Massive appreciation to [Doug Latornell](http://douglatornell.ca "Doug
Latornell") for continuing development of Blogofile, the static blog compiler
that powers this site.  His contributions can be found at the official [blogofile GitHub repo](https://github.com/EnigmaCurry/blogofile/ "Blogofile GitHub repo").

Converting the layout to Bootstrap was a breeze thanks to the Mako templates.

This is a lackluster post, but I didn't want to let such a big layout change go
by without mention.  Customization of the default Bootstrap theme is coming.

*Update* Thanks Doug, I've updated the GitHub link to point to the official repo.
