For an [HCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) class project in Fall 2009, I pulled together some of my previous demos to make this integrated tool.  It was just a prototype, and I haven't taken the time to get the code set up and working on this blog.  If anyone is interested, I can dig up the code and send it along.

In retrospect, it really could have used some narration...
