[Pale Blue Pixel][9] is this blog.  I write technical posts about web
development, image processing, amateur graphics, and generally celebrating the
art and craft of programming.  The name *Pale Blue Pixel* is a meek tribute to
Carl Sagan's [Pale Blue Dot][pbd].

It's currently powered by:

 - **[Python][2]** - a large and powerful snake

 - **CSS Grid** - framework-free CSS thanks to grid and flexbox
 - **[LESS][5]** - CSS preprocessor
