<p>I made a handful of <a href="/tag/aejs/" title="Posts about AEJS">posts about AEJS</a> while it was still being developed.</p>
<p>I started development on it for some damn good reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The HTML5 era introduced new APIs which finally made it possible: 
   <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays" title="JavaScript typed arrays">Typed arrays</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/" title="Web Audio API">Web Audio</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/" title="File API">File</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/" title="Canvas 2D context">Canvas</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/fullscreen/" title="Fullscreen API">Fullscreen</a>,
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/" title="Gamepad API">Gamepad</a></li>
<li>JavaScript performance was finally good enough to make it feasible</li>
<li>It bridged front-end web development with low-level machine code, both of
   which are super awesome</li>
<li>I still have the Amiga 500 I played with obsessively since 3 years-old</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000" title="Motorola 68000">68000</a> is legendary and I wanted to find out why</li>
</ul>
<p>I stopped development for some equally good reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I became busy with other projects which could be finished in a reasonable
   timeframe (I'm looking at you, <a href="http://colorpal.org/" title="ColorPal">ColorPal</a>)</li>
<li>The final nail in the coffin was realizing that while JavaScript was
   definitely up to the task, there was pretty much no reason to write it
   entirely in JavaScript when it could be written in C and compiled to JS with
   <a href="http://emscripten.org" title="emscripten">emscripten</a>.  The result would be faster, more robust, and type-safe.</li>
</ul>

<div class="row">
    <div class="text-center col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
        <img src="http://palebluepixel.org/static/projects/aejs/splash.png" 
        title="AEJS splash screen" alt="AEJS splash screen" />
    </div>
</div>

<hr />
<p>Astoundingly observant readers will notice that <a href="https://github.com/naTmeg/ScriptedAmigaEmulator" title="ScriptedAmigaEmulator">Scripted Amiga Emulator</a>
came out at around the same time I stopped contributing to AEJS.  It's based on
<a href="https://github.com/tonioni/WinUAE" title="WinUAE">WinUAE</a> and was ported (by hand, I believe) from C++ to JavaScript.  A very
impressive project, but not at all what I was going for with AEJS.  AEJS was
about fueling my curiosity and exploration.  SAE is extremely impressive and
works very well, but it didn't demotivate me in any way.</p>
<p>I may come up with some even better reasons to resume development at some point
in the future.  I still love my old Amiga 500 and want to see it live on in
some fashion.  I don't like having pet projects nipping at my heels that never
go anywhere, though, so I'm calling this one dead (<a href="https://github.com/mwcz/AEJS/" title="AEJS on GitHub">for now</a>).</p>
<p><em>Addendum</em>: I just learned today (2013-12-16) that Christian Stefansen ported
PUAE (Portable Universal Amiga Emulator) to PNaCl.  This allows UAE to run
inside any Chrome browser.  <a href="http://pnacl-amiga-emulator.appspot.com/" title="PNaCl port of PUAE">Check it out</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cstefansen/PUAE" title="PNaCl PUAE port's source code">fork it</a>.</p>
