            <p>Within the last two days, WebAssembly (<strong>wasm</strong>) has graced the eyeballs of
every JavaScript developer.  If wasm is new to you, the articles linked at the
end of this post fully describe what wasm <em>is</em>.</p>
<p>Since that's been covered, I'd like to talk about one impact wasm will
hopefully have on future of computing.  To set the scene, a quote from the man
himself:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Meanwhile, I took one quick step that would demonstrate the concept of the
        Web as a universal, all-encompassing space.  I programmed the browser so it
        could follow links not only to files on HTTP servers, &hellip;</p>
    <p>In one fell swoop, a huge amount of the information that was already on the
        Internet was available on the Web.</p>
    <footer>
        <cite>
            Tim Berners-Lee, Weaving the Web, 1999
        </cite>
    </footer>
</blockquote>

<p>This realization is pretty potent.  The web has taken over the world because of
the power of linking things together, even things not yet on the web.  Of HTML,
HTTP, and URL, the big three inventions of the early web, Tim saw the
now-humble URL as the most vital.  Today, we can effortlessly follow URLs to
most any type of media file, but the keystone is still missing.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, the JavaScript revolution has been trying to make real
the dream of <strong>following a URL to an application</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the announcement, I read every bit of documentation currently available,
about a dozen articles, joined the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/">W3C Community Group</a>, and have
been hanging out in the IRC channel (<code>irc://irc.w3.org:6667/#webassembly</code>).  I
don't want to speak too soon, but I'm pretty well convinced that wasm is the
next revolution.</p>

A few thoughts about the future of wasm:

### Live installs

wasm has the potential to be the LiveCD of applications.  Imagine visiting a
wasm application in your browser.  If it's great, you might want to install it
locally.
