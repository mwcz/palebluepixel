In the midst of this beastly summer we've just entered, nothing seems farther
away than the lung-clenching air of winter.  When things are this hot, and
pools and popsicles fail to cool, there's one foolproof way to get into the
spirit of winter: The Lurking Horror.

The Lurking Horror is a classic Infocom text adventure and a sibling of Zork.
For best results, couple this game with Cool-Retro-Term, a Cathode-Ray-Tube
terminal monitor simulator.  <abbr title="Cool-Retro-Term">CRT</abbr> boots you
off your 2015 high-DPI display and beams you into a world of 1980s nostalgia.

First [install cool-retro-term][install].  Then install [frotz][frotz] (the
Z-Machine engine which runs all the old Infocom text adventures).

    sudo yum install frotz

Locate `LURKING.DAT` in your copy of Lurking Horror, and...

    frotz LURKING.DAT

Crank up the AC, grab your clicky keyboard, make CRT fullscreen, turn off the
lights, and bathe in the cool cathode rays.
