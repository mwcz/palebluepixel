                <h2>ColorPal palettes improved!</h2>
<p>10 Feb 2012</p>

<div>
<p><a href="/projects/colorpal"><static/images src="/static/images/019/colorpal_logo.png" alt="ColorPal logo" title=""
/></a></p>

<p>In my <a href="/2012/01/16/colorpal-alpha/">last post</a> on the subject, I introduced
ColorPal, my HTML5 color palette generation tool.  It didn&#39;t perform well with
certain types of images, so I fixed it. :)</p>

<p>Color palettes will now match the image even better.  Especially for images
with infrequent but <em>important</em> colors.  Here&#39;s a comparison of the old and new
methods, on an image that is mostly black:</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/019/median-mean-comparison.png" alt="comparison of palettes generated with median and
mean"></p>

<p>You can see that with the old method, the black pixels definitely took over the
palette.</p>

<p><a href="/projects/colorpal">Try it with your own images!</a></p>

<p>For some images, this change won&#39;t affect palettes at all.  But for images with
low-population, high-importance colors, like the one above, palettes will look
<em>much</em> better!</p>

<p>Technical discussion below.</p>

<h1>Why the &#39;median&#39; in median-cut?</h1>

<p>Median Cut is an algorithm typically used to reduce the number of colors in an
image.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/019/median-cut-example.png" alt="16 million colors versus 16 colors"></p>

<p>The steps to perform median cut are fairly straightforward:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find the smallest box which contains all the colors.</p></li>
<li><p>Sort the enclosed colors along the longest axis of the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Split the box into two regions at median of the sorted list.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat the above process until the original color space has been divided
 into N regions where N is the number of colors you want.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Not too bad, right?  The question remains, though, why median?</p>

<p>Mean, median, and mode all attempt to measure the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_parameter">location</a> of a probability
distribution.  Worded more intuitively... they try to find the center of a set
of numbers.  They just employ different definitions of &quot;center&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/019/mean_median_mode.png" alt="mean, median, and mode graphed">
(Thanks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>As you can see clearly in the dashed data set, the mean tends to follow the
tail.  In other words, mean is useful when outliers are important.  When
generating a color palette, outliers are essential.  Outliers may be the small
streak of color in an otherwise drab sky, or a small red rose in the middle of
a green field.</p>

<p>The goal of median cut is <em>not</em> to generate a color palette.  It&#39;s to
efficiently reduce the number of colors in an image.  Since my goal with
ColorPal is to find good-lookin&#39; colors, I&#39;ve modified the algorithm to split
boxes at the <strong>mean</strong> instead of the <strong>median</strong>.  Mean splits boxes closer to
the outliers, which keeps low-population colors nicely segregated from the
high-population colors.</p>

<p>Thus step 3 becomes:</p>

<div class="pygments_murphy syntax_highlight">
  3. Split the box into two regions at the <b>mean</b> of the sorted list.
</div>

<p>The result?  Mean Cut!  Also: awesome color palettes.</p>

<h2>Interesting side-note on color distributions</h2>

<p>Interestingly, photographs of nature tend to have nice, close-to-normal color
distributions.  A &quot;normal distribution&quot; is a formal term for a &quot;bell curve&quot;.</p>

<p>Check out the red, green, and blue distributions for a photograph of a forest.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/019/forest_r.png" alt="Forest red   pixel distribution">
<img src="/static/images/019/forest_g.png" alt="Forest green pixel distribution">
<img src="/static/images/019/forest_b.png" alt="Forest blue  pixel distribution"></p>

<p>For comparison, here are the distributions for a shot of NYC.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/019/city_r.png" alt="City   red   pixel distribution">
<img src="/static/images/019/city_g.png" alt="City   green pixel distribution">
<img src="/static/images/019/city_b.png" alt="City   blue  pixel distribution"></p>

<h2>What&#39;s next for ColorPal?  Color spaces.</h2>

<p>Mean-cut improves ColorPal dramatically for some images, but it&#39;s still not
perfect.  Perfection probably won&#39;t be attainable, but there are still many
ways to improve.</p>

<p>My next test will be converting to a color space other than RGB.</p>

<p>HSL is common, and the RGB/HSL conversion formulas are in my very old JSImage
project.  It may not turn out well, though, as the concept of &quot;widest box&quot;
loses most of its meaning when each axis is a completely different unit of
measure.  Although, in a way, I suppose RGB has a similar problem.  Red, Green,
and Blue could be thought of as unrelated units.  I&#39;ll try it out and see how
it goes.  I wonder if my old JavaScript RGB/HSL code has rotted away yet...</p>

<p>Most likely, I&#39;ll skip HSL and try one of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space">Lab</a> color spaces first, since
they are not composed linear values like RGB and HSL.  Instead, Lab color
spaces use non-linear scales that closely match human perception of color.
Perfect for my purposes.  How fortuitious for me that CIE invented it way back
in 1931.</p>

<p>There are three &quot;Lab&quot; color spaces: XYZ, Hunter-Lab,
and CIELAB.  XYZ will be first to the plate, since the RGB/XYZ formulas are
the simplest.  Let me take this opportune moment to plug
<a href="http://www.easyrgb.com/index.php?X=MATH">EasyRGB.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Lend a hand</h2>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned before, ColorPal is in an early stage of development.  It
needs testing in multiple browsers, and I&#39;m very interested in hearing people&#39;s
feedback.  Code development help is welcomed too.</p>

<p>If you try out ColorPal, shoot me an <a href="mailto:mwc@clayto.org">email</a>
or give me a shout on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mwcz">Twitter</a> with your
thoughts.  Thanks!</p>
