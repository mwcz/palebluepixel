            <p>Imagine a solitary blue dot.</p>
<p><img alt="small dot" src="https://palebluepixel.org/2014/10/30/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/smalldot.png" /></p>
<p>Unless you let your imagination run away with itself, this is going to be a
pretty boring dot.  Now, imagine a second, larger dot (you can pick the color).</p>
<p><img alt="small dot and large dot" src="https://palebluepixel.org/2014/10/30/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/smalldot-largedot.png" /></p>
<p>Red, nice choice!  The scene is now slightly more interesting, since now you've
got two dots to think about.  You can ponder their positions, and relative
sizes.  No motion though; still pretty boring!</p>
<p>Pretty soon, your keen and restless mind will imagine that the larger dot
exerts a gravitational pull on the smaller one.  The small dot begins moving
towards the large one.  It's speed increases exponentially the closer it gets.
Now an orbit can form.  Thanks, Newton!</p>
<p><img alt="orbit" src="https://palebluepixel.org/2014/10/30/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/orbit.gif" title="When I recorded this gif, it lined up *completely* by chance.  So lucky.  It would have been a PITA to try to line up the dot so the orbit looped smoothly!  There is a slight jump, but it's subtle." /></p>
<p>The dot's orbit is reminiscent of a planet orbiting a star.  Neat.</p>
<p>Wait, did you see that?  You just moved the big dot.  Look again!  Now there
are thousands and thousands of tiny dots, each being accelerated toward the big
dot!</p>

<p>Peculiar.  The multitude of dots starts to look <em>oddly</em> reminiscent of fluid
sloshing around in a container.  Or a cloud of gas forming a star.  Weird, huh?
Maybe they're the same thing!</p>
<p>Now, before I ramble on any further, let your imagination take a rest while you
try out the simulation!</p>

Firefox 4+ or Chrome 9+.</p>
<h2>The Premise</h2>
<p><strong>Players wave illuminated batons around and cool stuff happens!</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="/2014/08/25/particles-and-p-dimo-comes-to-life/">DiMo Comes to Life</a> for a , not-at-all dramatized
summary of DiMo.</p>
<p>"DiMo" is a recurring interactive art exhibit at GeekSpark, which is held
during SparkCon each year in Raleigh, NC.  This year, I created the particle
gravity simulation visualization for DiMo.  There was also a visualization of
Conway's Game of Life, and an original game where players eat doritos and spray
soda at people who eat doritos.</p>
<h2>Particles</h2>
<p>The particles' main job is to swirl around and look cool.  They are pulled
gravitationally toward the player pieces, but the particles themselves don't
exert gravity on each other.</p>
<h3>Gravity</h3>
<p>The gravity calculation was written first with inlined calculations, then with
ThreeJS vector objects, then with <a href="http://glmatrix.net/">glmatrix</a>, and then inlined again.  The
inlined code performance wasn't distinguishable from the glmatrix
implementation.  Since glmatrix is very fast and much more readable, I stuck
with it for a while.</p>
<p>ThreeJS's vector calculations, on the other hand, were awful.  Each function
call created a new vector object.  Each acceleration calculation caused the
creation of 12 vector objects.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span> 10,000 particles    *
    60 fps           *
    12 objects       *
     3 player pieces
---------------------------------
 21,600,000 new objects per second
</pre></div>


<p>Needless to say, the performance was <em>terrible</em>.  I then implemented the gravity
equation using glmatrix's in-place vector operations.  glmatrix's vector
functions insert their output into an existing vector instead of creating a new
vector for each function call, like ThreeJS' API does.  The number of new
objects created per second by the gravity equation dropped from <code>21,600,000</code>
down to zero.</p>
<p>glmatrix served quite well for a while, but in the end I improved performance
even more by writing an inline gravity equation by hand.  Perhaps it was just
function call overhead that was hurting performance.</p>
<h3>Coloring methods</h3>
<p>Once the gravity function was implemented, some beautification was in order.</p>
<p>Originally, each particle was randomly assigned either red, green, or blue.</p>
<p><img alt="early dimo image, with randomly assigned colors" src="https://palebluepixel.org/2014/10/30/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/random-colors.png" /></p>
<p>The gravitational swirls may look kinda cool, but the colors are hectic.  This
<em>isn't</em> one of those rare cases where randomness is beautiful.  It occurred to
me that seeing big swaths of color through all the particles might look
better.</p>
<h4>Cololololololors</h4>
<p>But what criteria should be used to decide what color each particle should
receive?</p>
<p>The simplest approach would be to color the particles based on their distance
from the players, and that's essentially what I did.  The equations below use
each particle's speed <em>and</em> acceleration to determine what color they should be
assigned each frame.</p>
<figure>
    <div role="math">
        n = \dfrac{2\pi \cdot \lvert\vec{v}\rvert \cdot \lvert\vec{a}\rvert}{a_{max}}
    </div>
    <div role="math">
        \red{R(n)}   = \dfrac{\cos(n + 1.76714) + 1}{2}
    </div>
    <div role="math">
        \green{G(n)} = \dfrac{\cos(n + 3.92699) + 1}{2}
    </div>
    <div role="math">
        \blue{B(n)} = \dfrac{\cos(n + 5.89048) + 1}{2}
    </div>
</figure>

<p><span role="math">\vec{a}</span> is the acceleration vector, and <span
role="math">\vec{v}</span> is the velocity vector.  <span
role="math">a_{max}</span> is the maximum magnitude an acceleration vector is
allowed to have (configurable via the "max accel" parameter in the UI config
panel).  The decimal constants are there to evenly distribute the waves, and
because I was too lazy to figure out the correct fraction to use.</p>
<p>The range of <code>cos</code> and <code>sin</code> are <code>-1..1</code>, but the color values I needed are
<code>0..1</code>.  The <code>+1</code> addition shifts the output into <code>0..2</code>, and the <code>/2</code> division
scales it down to <code>0..1</code>.</p>
<p>When graphed, they look like this.</p>
<p><img alt="Roughly evenly-spaced sine waves" src="https://palebluepixel.org/2014/10/30/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/sine_waves.png" /></p>
<p>The cosine allows the colors to cycle repeatedly (R,G,B,R,G,B,...) as the
input, <span role="math">n</span>, increases.  Here's the result.</p>
<p><img alt="image of the swaths of color" src="https://palebluepixel.org/2014/10/30/dimo-the-deconstruction-of-falling-stars/swath-colors.png" /></p>
<p><em>Yes!</em>  Swaths of color, cycling through the spectrum like a rainbow.</p>
<h4>The Grand Programmers' Utopia (GPU)</h4>
<p>After bumping up against my CPU's limits while implementing gravity, I was
certain of one thing: I wanted to rely on the CPU as little as possible.</p>
<p>I had a vague intuition that pixel shaders were the answer, since, hey, pixel
shaders control the colors of pixels, right?  It turned out my understanding of
shaders was pretty far off, but they <em>are</em> the right tool for the job.</p>
<p>Shaders are small programs that run on your video card's processor(s) (the
"GPU").  They come in a variety of languages, but shaders in WebGL are written
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">GLSL</a>, a subset of C.</p>
<p>Learning about and writing the shaders was the most fun and educational aspect
of this project, mostly because graphics programming is uniquely rewarding
among all types of programming.  Often an unanticipated quirk of an equation
(or even a typo!) will result in a very cool surprise.  In short, "just trying
stuff" pays off <em>far</em> more than in any other branch of programming.</p>
<h4>More than colors?</h4>
<p>The more particles I add to the visualization, the better it looks.  1,000
particles just look like a bunch of specks, but 100,000 particles start to look
like clouds of swirling vapor.  Since the gravity calculations are so
demanding, I wanted to offload as much work as possible onto the GPU.</p>
<p>The Web doesn't currently have an API for doing general-purpose calculations on
the GPU (although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebCL">WebCL</a> is in the pipeline).  It is possible to do
limited calculations, by doing your calculation in a fragment shader and
encoding the results, as pixel color values, into an in-memory texture (FBO).</p>
<p>Sadly, a combination of limited time and inexperience prevented me from getting
the gravity calculations onto the GPU.</p>
<p>In 2012, Edouard Coulon created a similar particle gravity simulation called
<a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/gpu-particle-attractors/?f=">GPU Particle Attractors</a>, using the texture approach, and
achieved 1,000,000 particles.  Tragically, his website is gone and I couldn't
find his demo hosted anywhere else.  Edouard, if you read this, please reach
out to me.  I'd love to learn from your work.</p>
<p>In the end, I had to settle for 25,000 particles on my laptop.  For the art
installation, we used a pretty beefy gaming rig, and I was able to bump it up
to 50,000 (thanks Charan!).</p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>Here's my wishlist for further improvements to the visualization.</p>
<ul>
<li>do gravity calculations on the GPU, which would enable either...<ul>
<li>several orders of magnitude more particles, or</li>
<li>particles can exert gravity on each other</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>add a calibration system which would determine how many particles a user's
   computer is capable of rendering</li>
<li>adjust the canvas sizing code, to allow the visualization to be easily
   embedded in other pages (it currently full-screens itself)</li>
<li>add even more configuration parameters and presets.  DiMo is capable of a
   nice range of effects and patterns, but many of them require nitpicky
   tweaking of sliders</li>
</ul>
<p>More likely, I'll use what I learned from DiMo on a super-secret future
project.</p>
