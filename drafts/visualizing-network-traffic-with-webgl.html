            <p>"<em>Cool,</em>" I thought, "<em>an excuse to play with WebGL at work!</em>"</p>
<p>This year, I had the good fortune to contribute to a keynote presentation at
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/summit">Red Hat Summit</a>.  This keynote specifically is presented every year by
Burr Sutter.  Burr is famous for giving complex live demos, and for being
uncannily immune to Murphy's Law.</p>
<p>Pipelined microservices were the subject of this year's demo.  To demonstrate
it, an audience of about 5,000 people played a videogame we created.  The game
was powered by five microservices: Achievement, Score, Mechanics, Gamebus, and
PlayerID.  While the audience played, new versions of those microservices were
deployed, either to a small number of users (canary) or by toggling between two
environments (blue/green).</p>
<p>My contribution was to give some extra visual punch to the active microservices
by visualizing every network request they send and receive.  For instance, when
a <em>blue</em> service toggles to <em>green</em>, it will be reflected in the patterns of
network traffic.</p>
<h3>Tiny Particles of Sand</h3>
<p>While developing <a href="/projects/dimo">DiMo</a> and <a href="http://kimotion.xyz">Kimotion</a>, I became
fond of <a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a> particle systems for their power and flexibility.</p>
<div class="row">

<p>With an audience of 5,000 people generating network traffic, the number of
requests would exceed what could be comfortably rendered with DOM elements and
CSS transitions/animations.  A WebGL particle system was the clear choice to
achieve that kind of performance.</p>
<p>The next step was to show that it's possible to overlay a 3D scene on top of a
standard webpage.  three.js makes it easy to give your scene a transparent
background, allowing the page to show through.  Here's a torus knot floating
over the pipeline.</p>
<p><img alt="3d torus overlaid on standard webpage" src="/static/images/041/3d-overlay.png" /></p>
<p>{# consider removing this paragraph #}</p>
<p>Interacting with the page below was still a problem though, because the
transparent canvas soaked up all mouse clicks.  The simple CSS property
<code>pointer-events: none</code> prevents the canvas from intercepting mouse and touch
events.</p>
<h3>GLSL</h3>
<p>When a network request is detected, the particle system activates a tiny dot
which travels in an arc from point A to point B.  The arcs are defined by sine
waves.  Here are the particle arcs as they appear normally, and another shot
with sine wave guides showing.</p>
<div class="row">
    <figure class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="/static/images/041/pipeline-nosines.png" alt="pipeline with traffic particles" />
        <figcaption>Pipeline with particles moving in arcs</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="col-sm-6">
        <img src="/static/images/041/pipeline-sines.png" alt="pipeline with sine wave guides" />
        <figcaption>Pipeline with sine wave guides</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>To prevent the paths from overlapping too much, I increased each wave's
amplitude based on vertical distance to be traveled.  That's why the purple arc
is much smaller than the blue arc, which is smaller than the green arc, etc.</p>
<p>Initially, the particles traveled in a single-file line, which made it
difficult to discern how many of them there were.  To remedy that, I added a
small random horizontal offset to each particle.  The offset has less effect at
the ends of the arc, but causes the particles to fan out near the middle.</p>
<p>The particles that enter from the right side of the screen represent network
traffic from the audience.  The origination point of those particles moves
randomly up and down to add more visual interest.</p>
<h3>Together at Last</h3>
<p>After months of collaborating from across the world, it was wonderful to meet
the whole team in person.</p>

<h3>Glow Rope</h3>
<p>Early in the project, before real traffic data was available, I used mouse
coordinates to control the path of each particle.  It was pretty fun, so I spun
it off into a simple WebGL demo called <a href="/demos/glow-rope">Glow Rope</a>.  Give it a try!</p>

<h3>Leaderboard</h3>
<p>In addition to the network traffic visualization, I helped build the
leaderboard view to display the scores and achievements of the top 10 players.
<a href="https://twitter.com/andresgalante/">Andres</a> created the beautiful design and handed me a static mockup
which I converted into a dynamic template using <a href="http://ractivejs.org/">Ractive</a>.  I then
created a WebSocket connection to the <em>score microservice</em> to populate the
data.  Here's a shot of the winners from the live audience.</p>
