Humans have had it rough for the past few centuries.  Emotionally, I mean.  It
used to be so clear that we were privileged.  How could it not be so?  Our
planet was the fulcrum around which every heavenly body in the universe
orbited.  We were the dominant form of life on Earth, and we were fairly
certain that ourselves and our world were the creation of a loving but
tempermental and sometimes murdery god.

Things have changed, and we aren't as privileged as we once thought we were.
The second chapter of [The Varieties of Scientific Experience][varieties] by
Carl Sagan, documents the following demerits:

 - Our Earth orbits around the sun.  Our planet is not central.

 - The Sun is not the center of the universe.  Again, not central.

 - Our solar system is not even at the center of our galaxy.  That wasn't
   discovered until the 1920s.

 - Our galaxy is also not at the center of anything in particular.  Carl
   describes it as being in the "boondocks" of the universe.

 - Our Sun is a boring, typical star, with no special features to distinguish
   it from the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 other stars universe.

 - Stars are not eternal, as we once thought.  They coalesce, burn, and die.

 - Not only that, stars are made of the same stuff we find right here on our
   Earth, which could be said diminishes their majesty.  On the other hand,
   *we* are made of the same matter as stars.

 - Our earth is approximately 4,500,000,000 years old.  Humans have existed for
   only a very short time, 1,000,000 years or so.  We are a newcomer, and did
   not emerge at the same time (or same week) as the rest of our world.

 - Humans as a species are not elevated above other life on Earth.  We have a
   common lineage.

 - The way we experience time is not from a [privileged frame of
   reference][refframe].  There is nothing special about our position or our
   motion.

Carl then suggests that one idea of human privilege is still with us.

> Well, if we don't have a distinctive position or velocity or acceleration, or
> a separate origin from the other plants and animals, then at least, maybe, we
> are the smartest beings in the entire universe.

Carl goes on to say that discovering extraterrestrial intelligence will silence
this latest in a long line of human conceits.  Whatever other outcomes an
indisputible alien encounter would have, I'm quite sure Carl is right about
this one.  However, there is another aspirant approaching, and it is almost
ready to snatch the *Smartest Kids in the Universe* trophy from humanity's
collective hands.

The next great blow to our egos will be the discovery that intelligence can
arise from ordinary matter, that is, melted sand.  Artificial intelligence is
controversial and complex, but I'm quite certain the intelligence of our
technology will continue to increase, and the vastness of the universe suggests
to me that we will probably create intelligence long before we discover it on
another planet.

How AI would change our existence is difficult to imagine, but there will
certainly be people resisting it.  They might say, "it's an act", or "it's not
human, it can't feel".  Many, maybe even most, people will not accept AI as
truly intelligent.  In a way, it would be the ultimate out-group.

Carl again:

> A grinding of heels can be heard screeching across the last five centuries as
> scientists have revealed the noncentrality of our position and as many others
> have fought to resist that insight to the bitter end.



For anyone wishing to achieve a healthy sense of self-worth, I cannot recommend
seeking approval from the universe.
