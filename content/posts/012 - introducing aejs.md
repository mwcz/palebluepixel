Introducing AEJS, an Amiga emulator written in JavaScript.  Wait, wording it like that makes it sound like it's finished.  It isn't.  It won't be for a long time.  AEJS is just a hobby, and will never hold a candle to UAE.

Why the Amiga?  Given that this is my first emulator, it would have been much easier to go with a 6502 or 8080 instead, but I didn't grow up with those; I grew up with a 68k powering an Amiga 500.

Why JavaScript?  Fabrice Bellard didn't make any excuses for writing an x86 emulator in JavaScript, so I won't either.

I'll be using this blog to share updates on the project.  Progress, problems, etc.  Anyone with interest or knowledge of 68k arch or Amiga chipsets is welcome to get involved.

Next up: completing the code to generate an opcode lookup table.
