The Minimic is great.  I just received mine last week, and I'm loving the ability to join video calls with [nice, comfy headphones][grado].  It's much better than switching back and forth between headphones and a headset.

The only problem is that, since the minimic is just *a wire*, it doesn't have any noise or echo cancellation.  And since Fedora doesn't come with that feature enabled by default, the mic was picking up a lot of ambient noise.  [Breddy][breddy] told me that steps just like the following didn't work in Fedora a few versions ago, so I wanted to document them now that the issues seem to be fixed.  I originally found these instructions on [this r/linux post][rlinux] and am reposting them here with Fedora-specific flourishes.

Without further ado, here's how to turn on noise and echo cancellation in Fedora 26.

---

## If you just want it to work

If you're in a rush, here's a script that will set everything up for you.

    :::bash
    sudo dnf install -y webrtc-audio-processing
    echo '.nofail' | sudo tee -a /etc/pulse/default.pa
    echo 'load-module module-echo-cancel aec_method=webrtc' | sudo tee -a /etc/pulse/default.pa
    pulseaudio -k

---

## Again, but with explanation

The first step is to install the WebRTC audio processing package.  It *may* come by default with Fedora.  My machine had it installed already, but I'm including it here in case it was simply a dependency of some other package I've installed.

    :::bash
    sudo dnf install webrtc-audio-processing

Then add these two lines to the end of `/etc/pulse/default.pa`.

    :::bash
    .nofail
    load-module module-echo-cancel aec_method=webrtc

Then restart PulseAudio.

    :::bash
    pulseaudio -k

Now, if you open Sound settings, you should see a new entry under the *Input* tab.  Mine is called "**Built-in Audio Analog Stereo (echo cancelled with SA9027 USB Audio Analog Stereo)**".  Not sure what's up with that name; my mic is connected with a 3.5mm audio jack.  Whatever, it works!

Select the device that says "echo cancelled" and your audio background hiss should drop to almost nothing.  Here's a before and after spectrum analysis.
