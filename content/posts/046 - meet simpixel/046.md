I'm glad everyone could make it.  SimPixel, meet everyone.  Everyone, SimPixel.

<div id="simpixel-container"></div>

SimPixel is a WebGL visualizer for LED displays, very much like the ones Adam
and Dan build over at [Maniacal Labs][mlabs].  *So* much like them, in fact,
that I built most of SimPixel while sitting at Adam's workbench.  If you too
would like to take a seat at Adam's illustrious workbench someday, [have at
it][source].

BiblioPixel, <abbr title="Maniacal Labs">ML's</abbr> light animation library,
is currently the one tool that speaks to SimPixel.  That may change in the
future.  Here's how.


## The Protocol

By itself, SimPixel is useless.  To turn on the lights, it connects over a
[WebSocket][ws] to a service.  That service is expected to send certain messages,
namely a configuration message, and a series of color messages.

The configuration message specifies how the LEDs are arranged in space.

The color message(s) specify what color each LED should be at that moment in
time.

For more, see [the protocol reference][protocol].

## Record & Replay

The live demo above uses the protocol, but it isn't connected to any WebSocket
service.  Instead, it's using a recording apparatus that I cobbled together.  I
pushed a configuration frame and a bunch of color frames into an array,
converted their bytes into base64 strings, and saved those into [a quite large
JSON recording file][rec].

The recording mechanism is only interesting because of the following.  While
tweaking the number of color frames so the animation would loop smoothly, a
fascinating pattern took shape in the text.  I zoomed out more.
