Long live the computer revolution!

[The computer revolution hasn't started yet, OOPSLA 1997][1] - Alan Kay.
Amazing talk.

Alan Kay's primary contribution to computing has been the coining of hilarious
one-liners which programmers use to deflect despair caused by the freakishly
mis-designed systems they are forced to work with.

"Arrogance in computer science is measured in nano-Dijkstras"

I can't help but wonder whether the tremendous mess of mismatched interfaces
and incompatibilities is somehow necessary to the process of creating great
software.

Every bit of elegance we see in the natural world is driven by almost-chaos
when you look deeper.

Things *tend* this way or that way, but if you looked too closely at a cloud of
gas, you'd think it were pure chaos.  Statistical trends can look like elegance
once you zoom out.
