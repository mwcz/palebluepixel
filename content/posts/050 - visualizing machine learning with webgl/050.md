Things to cover:

 - the story, context of the demo (not experts, viz tells story, not for nitpickers)
 - decomposing images into pixel cloud
 - getting input from Infinispan/JDG and Gluster (via microservice B)
 - GPU-based movement algorithm, CPU only for timer, achieving uniform velocity
 - the 'path tracer' tool to more easily encode paths
 - layered pipes setup, link to andres and matt (show angled cutaway of the images, can probably make it with inkscape perspective tool: http://goinkscape.com/using-perspective-for-3d-in-inkscape/ )
