JSImage was a basic, buggy, just-for-fun image processing library that I wrote
in 2008/2009 when I first started seriously studying JavaScript.

A stumbled across a [book][1] in my university library, and started
implementing the algorithms on the newly available HTML5 canvas element.

I've made [several posts][2] about JSImage which contain live demos.

I think I put more work into code formatting than correct output. ;)
