THIS IS A POST ABOUT THE COLOR PALETTE TOOLS OF MY FORMER AND CURRENT PHOTO SITES
UNFINISHED

I've been toying with color palette generation for years.  My photography website has always had some form of dynamic palette, so the theme of each page matches the photo.  I owe the idea to [Noah Grey](http://noahgrey.com).  Each iteration of my [photography site](http://clayto.com/) gets slightly more advanced palette generation.

Here's the use case:

1. I want to post an image to my photo site
2. Log in
3. 

First iteration (circa 2003)

1. Log into my site, click *Add Photo*
2. Choose the photo to upload, click *Next*
3. Photo is shown along with 
Very basic.  `event.pageX - static/images.offsetLeft`

Second iteration (circa 2005)

Third iteration (circa 2008)
