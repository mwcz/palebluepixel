This is a demo from late 2009.  It's an extension of the single-pixel [eyedropper](/2011/11/16/html5-canvas-eyedropper/) I wrote previously.

It's powered by an early version of an old JS toolkit I wrote called JSImage.  The latest version is available at my [JSImage github repo](https://github.com/mwcz/jsimage).  Don't be fooled by the 2011 commits, those are just artifacts from svn-&gt;git migration.  No guarantees that the histo's are actually correct. :)

I used an old version of a rectangular selection tool called marquee.  I believe it's still located [here](http://marqueetool.net/) but I can't be totally sure that's the same project.

Click, drag, and taste the magic. :|

<canvas id="c0">
    Your browser does not support the &lt;canvas&gt; element. Lame.
</canvas>

<style type="text/css">
    canvas {
        margin     : 0 auto;
        outline    : 36px solid black;
        margin     : 46px auto;
        transition : 0.1168s all ease;
        display    : block;
        cursor     : crosshair;
    }
</style>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/004/marker.css" />

<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/004/marquee/prototype_reduced.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/004/marquee/rectmarquee.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/004/JSImage.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">

$(function() {

    images0 = new JSImage( "c0", "/static/images/004/kazoo.png" );
    setTimeout(function(){images0.draggable();},100); // enable the selection

});

</script>
