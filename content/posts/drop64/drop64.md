Drop64 is an easy drag-and-drop tool for generating [Data URIs][1] from any
file.

Check it out at [drop64.com][2].

Here's a demo recording of how easy it is.

Some benefits of Data URIs are:

 - Fewer HTTP requests means faster page loads
 - avoid cross-origin resource loading issues (fonts in Firefox, for example)
 - you can paste the Data URI directly into your web browser URL bar to view the file (occasionally convenient)

If you noticed the similarity to [ColorPal][3], well done!  I reused a lot of
ColorPal's code in Drop64.  Almost all of it, in fact.

For more information on Data URIs, check out [MDN][4] or the original [RFC][5].
