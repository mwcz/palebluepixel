[clayto.com][1] is my homemade photography website.

I started clayto.com in 2003.  Inspired by [Noah Grey's][6] photography
presentation ideas, the site's color scheme always matches the photo being
viewed, as Noah did (or used to!).

Here are four examples of the color schemes:

![example of color theme matching images]({filename}/static/images/projects/screenshot_clayto_palettes_small.png "example of color theme matching images")

Images [1][9], [2][10], [3][11], [4][12].

The color schemes are automatically generated when a photo is posted.  A
"suggested palette" is displayed, along with a color picker, and a tool to
sample colors directly from the image.

The site as it exists now was written in 2007-2008, as my first Django project.
It needs some serious TLC in the form of bringing it into the twenty-tens with
a responsive UI, [ColorPal][8] integration, visual redesign, and a Django
upgrade.

The site is currently powered by:

 - [Python][2] - an English comedy troupe
 - [Django][3] - Python web development framework
 - [960.gs][4] - a vintage CSS grid, groundbreaking at the time though
 - [Piwik][5] - open-source web analytics
 - and a custom color extraction algorithm that automatically suggests colors,
   then allows the user to tweak the colors to their liking

The code is [available here][7]
