Zorbio is a free multiplayer eat-em-up game that you can play in your browser!

Zorbio is currently in closed beta, but we'd be happy to give a beta key to
you.  Tweet at [me][mwcz] or [Jared][jared] and we'll hook you up.

Zorbio is brought to you by my good friend Jared Sprague and I, via our small
game development company, [Scripta, Inc][scripta].  As Scripta, we've developed
Zorbio as well as [Square Off](/projects/squareoff).

Follow Zorbio development on the [Scripta blog][scripta], or on [Facebook][fb].
