JSImage was a basic, buggy, just-for-fun image processing library that I wrote
in 2008/2009 when I first started seriously studying JavaScript.

A stumbled across a [book][1] in my university library, and started
implementing the algorithms on the newly available HTML5 canvas element.

I've made [several posts][2] about JSImage which contain live demos.

I don't recommend anyone use JSImage, but here's the code if you fancy a skim:

<div id="cp-repo"></div>

<script src="/static/js/repo.js"></script>
<script>
    $(function() {
        $('#cp-repo').repo({
            user: 'mwcz',
            name: 'JSImage'
        });
    });
</script>

I think I put more work into code formatting than correct output. ;)
